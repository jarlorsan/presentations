Outline
========================================================
1. Background
2. Pipes (`%>%`)  
  a. `%>%` as a concept  
  b. Applying `%>%` to data   
3. With great `%>%` comes great `%>%`  
  a. Pros and cons



Assumptions
========================================================
I assume you swim in the following pools of knowledge prior to digesting this information.

1. You have a basic understanding of the R programming language.  
  a. Scripts, object assignment, classes
2. You have a basic understanding of data manipulation and exploratory data analysis.  
  a. Cleaning, plotting, identifying patterns
3. You are interested in exploring more about R and how it is used collaboratively.  
  a. {tidyverse}, {dplyr}, {ggplot2}



Background
========================================================
What is a pipe (`%>%`)?

* Powerful R operator from `{magrittr}`
* Allows for an object to move into another sequence
* Popular dependency for other R packages (`{tidyverse}`)

```
Result <- Object %>% 
  Function1(Object) %>% 
  Function2(Function1(Object)) %>% 
  Function3(Function2(Function1(Object)))
```



Background (cont.)
========================================================
As stated by Stefan Milton Bache (created `{magrittr}`), the `%>%` aims to:

1. Decrease development time
2. Improve readability and maintainability of code

In my opinion, incorporating the `%>%` into your code also allows you to:

1. Perform multiple steps with one call
2. Organize your code to improve data analysis workflow
3. Strike balance between readability & efficiency

Dataset: [U.S. Government Spending on Kids](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md)

> This dataset provides a comprehensive accounting of public spending on children from 1997 through 2016. It draws on the US Census Bureauâ€™s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances, as well as several federal and other noncensus sources, to capture state-by-state spending on education, income security, health, and other areas.

Goals to accomplish for data analysis exercise:

1. Import data.
2. Filter data to only show Iowa's spending on elementary & secondary education over time.
3. Summarize data into a clean data visualization.
4. Prepare code for distribution to people of different backgrounds, expertise, etc.

`{base}` Implementation, Intermediate Steps


```r
kids_a <- subset(kids, state == "Iowa")
kids_b <- kids_a[kids_a$variable == "PK12ed", ]
kids_b$inf_adj_perchild_actual <- kids_b$inf_adj_perchild * 1000
kids_c <- kids_b[, c("year", "inf_adj_perchild_actual")]
plot(kids_c$year, kids_c$inf_adj_perchild_actual,
     main = "Iowa's Spending on Elementary & Secondary Education 1997-2016",
     sub = "Public prekindergarten spending transformed to be in 2016 dollars",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Amount ($)")

With great (pipe) power comes great (pipe) responsibility
========================================================
You are not always going to want to use the pipe.

1. Maybe you shouldn't do your entire grocery shopping trip all at once.  
  a. If I buy all my ingredients at once, then I am going to have to figure out how to use all my items and minimize food waste.  
  b. If I split my grocery shopping into x number of trips, then it may allow me to accomplish something else (i.e., having fresh stock of produce).
2. Prior to saving Princess Peach, Super Mario doesn't have to defeat all the enemies, collect all the coins and stars, and complete the stage all at once.  
  a. Speed run  
  b. Collecting resources (i.e., stocking up on green mushrooms/lives to prepare for boss battles)  

Consider when it is best to use the pipe (along with its pipe alternatives!).



Why should I use the Pipe again?
========================================================

1. Accomplish multiple steps in just one call of code.
2. Enhance readability of code.
3. Improve efficiency in developing and understanding code.
